## üëã Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile

I'm YinheeeChen, an undergraded student in Central South University. Here's a bit about me and my work:
### üìö Research Experience
- **CONF-MLA 2024(published)**
  - **University of Cambridge - Northwestern Polytechnical University (AI Specialization: Deep Reinforcement Learning, from Image Segmentation to NLP)**
  - **Supervisor**: Prof Pietro Li√≤ (Dec 2023 - Jun 2024)
  - Researched Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Machine Learning (ML) for Explainable AI (XAI).
  - **Publication**: First author of "Enhancing Stability and Explainability in Reinforcement Learning with Machine Learning," presented at CONF-MLA 2024.

- **WACV 2025(published)**
  - **Tsinghua University (AIGC)**
  - **Supervisor**: Hao Zhao (Jul 2024 - Sep 2024)
  - Researched visual anagram generation using Multi-Task Learning (MTL) techniques. Developed and applied MTL algorithms to diffusion models.
  - **Publication**: Co-first author of "Enhancing Diffusion-based Visual Anagram Generation via Multi-task Learning," accepted by WACV 2025.

- **ICML 2025(Under Review)**
  - **Central South University (AI for Science)**
  - **Supervisor**: Fei Guo (Oct 2024 - Feb 2025)
  - Led a project on Pocket-Peptide conformation generation using diffusion models. Combined diffusion models with flow matching and transformers for optimized performance.
  - **Publication**: Co-first author of "Pocket-Aware Peptide Conformation Generation via Tokenization and Diffusion Model," submitted to ICML 2025.

- **ICCV 2025(Under Review)**
  - **Tsinghua University (AIGC)**
  - **Supervisor**: Hao Zhao (Jan 2025 - Mar 2025)
  - Researched the application of RealFill in photomontage using the DiT model. Created a group selfie dataset and developed an automated pipeline for capturing the best moments from videos.
  - **Publication**: First author of "Catch The Moment! Automated Highlight Montage Synthesis for Group Selfies," submitted to ICCV 2025.
